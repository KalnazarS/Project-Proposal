1.	Write an executive summary 
Today, tourism begins to grow rapidly after the coronavirus pandemic, after which tourism worldwide has almost halved by as much as 74%. It is understandable - in an effort to protect themselves from infection with the virus, people were forced to stay at home, and the authorities closed the borders between states. But time passed and the situation in the world began to change. Since the middle of 2020, tourists have again begun to build their travel routes. The tourism sector began to gradually recover. However, it must be admitted that the COVID-19 virus still made some adjustments. So, for example, Kazakhstanis began to make a choice in favor of rest within the country more often than abroad. Already in 2021, the tourism industry in the world as a whole, and in Kazakhstan, in particular, began to recover. However, new tasks have appeared for the industry: to attract the attention of foreign and domestic tourists to Kazakhstan, to create comfortable and safe conditions for recreation, to increase the contribution to the state economy. Thus, it can be stated that the indicators of domestic tourism have been steadily growing for the second year in a row. According to official statistics, in the first quarter of 2022, the number of domestic tourists served by accommodation facilities increased by 121.5% compared to the same period in 2021, amounting to 1.13 million people.
  
2.	Explain the project background 
According to the British company Brand Finance, Kazakhstan maintained its position in 2019 and was one of the fastest growing national brands. In the top 100, the country took 44th place, moving up by 7 positions. In Euromonitor International's sustainable tourism ranking, Kazakhstan ranked 62nd out of 99 countries. Among the CIS countries, Belarus is in 26th place, Ukraine is in 30th place, Georgia is in 41st place, Russia is in 65th place. 

In a short time, Kazakhstan in the world ranking of the most visited countries is already catching up with European countries, and from the point of view of specialists, Kazakhstan will become a big key bridge Between Europe and Asia.
  
  
      3. Present a solution 
Since the concept of our application is based in a patriotic spirit, everything that will be developed in applications is intended for the development of Kazakhstan. Our main and key goal is to attract tourists from different countries, and to make sure that as many people as possible learn about our traditions and our beautiful places.
